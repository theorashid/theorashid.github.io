I wanted a site that was much quicker than all the hugo templates. And much less code â€“ better for the environment and all that. Site generated using [Mizi](https://github.com/abstractxan/Mizi). Inspired by [hundredrabbits/100r.co](100r.co).

## run
- Update `src/config.conf` for webpages
- Update `src/website.md`
- Build using `./build.sh` or Run `./src/mizi` to create site
- Open `index.html` which opens `site/home.html`
