## about
### 
I am a statistician (data scientist, applied scientist). I am particularly interested in Bayesian statistics, spatiotemoporal statistics, probabilistic programming, time series methods, and generative modelling.

I am a PhD student at Imperial College London looking at small-area trends in mortality in England using both Bayesian parametric and nonparametric models, under the supervision of [Majid Ezzati](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/majid.ezzati), [James Bennett](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/umahx99) and [Seth Flaxman](https://sethrf.com). Before that, I studied theoretical physics, also at Imperial College, so I like any excuse to dig into the maths to speed up and scale Bayesian models (e.g. conjugate Gibbs samplers). I also interned as an applied scientist at Amazon where I implemented multivariate, probabilistic time series models to forecast product demand.

I'm keen to meet with anyone to chat about forecasting/maths/cricket or anything you're working on that you think might interest me. If you're in London – or if you want to invite me to your part of the world – contact me using the links in the footer.

## work
### code
[probabilistic-programming-packages](https://github.com/theorashid/probabilistic-programming-packages). Implementing the same forecasting model in many probabilistic programming languages from python, R and Julia.
[mortality-statsmodel](https://github.com/theorashid/mortality-statsmodel). Scalable hierarchical Bayesian models for modelling mortality over space and time, in nimble and numpyro.
[numpyro](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/numpyro). Several contributions, including an example on spatiotemporal modelling, and the conditional autoregressive distribution

I'm also interested in [blackjax](https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax), [aemcmc](https://github.com/aesara-devs/aemcmc), [dynamax](https://github.com/probml/dynamax), [pymc](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc), [GPJax](https://github.com/thomaspinder/GPJax), [nimble](https://github.com/nimble-dev/nimble), and would like to contribute more when I get some time. If you're a developer of one of those projects and have something I can work on, please get in touch.
