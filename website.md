# Theo Rashid

## about
### 
I am a statistician (applied scientist, data scientist, machine learning person, etc.). I am particularly interested in Bayesian statistics, probabilistic programming, spatiotemoporal models, time series methods, and generative modelling.

I am currently working with [Seth Flaxman](https://sethrf.com) and the UN World Food Programme on modelling food insecurity using mobile phone survey data. I recently completed my PhD at Imperial College London looking at small-area trends in mortality in England using scalable Bayesian models, supervised by [Majid Ezzati](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/majid.ezzati), [James Bennett](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/umahx99) and [Seth Flaxman](https://sethrf.com). Before that, I studied theoretical physics, also at Imperial College, so I like any excuse to dig into the maths to speed up and scale Bayesian models (e.g. conjugate Gibbs samplers). I also interned as an applied scientist at Amazon where I implemented multivariate, probabilistic time series models to forecast product demand.

I'm keen to meet with anyone to chat about forecasting/maths/cricket or anything you're working on that you think might interest me. If you're in London – or if you want to invite me to your part of the world – contact me using the links in the footer.

[Journal of Open Source Software](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews). [Review of the GPJax package](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/4455).

I'm also interested in [blackjax](https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax), [dynamax](https://github.com/probml/dynamax), [GPJax](https://github.com/thomaspinder/GPJax), [nimble](https://github.com/nimble-dev/nimble), and would like to contribute more when I get some time. If you're a developer of one of those projects and have something I can work on, please get in touch.
